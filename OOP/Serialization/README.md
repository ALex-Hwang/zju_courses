1. Support the serialization of arithmetic types
2. Support c++ std::string
3. Support STL containers
4. `src/main.cpp` is the main program and contains all the test cases.
5. As to user-defined-types, plz check the `src/serialization.h` line 318 to 371 and implement the serialization fuction of your own struct.
6. The testing does not conclude all the arithmetic types C/C++ provides, since the implementation of the serialization is done with templates.
